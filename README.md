# ChocolateShop

## Overview
ChocolateShop is a simple Java console application that simulates a chocolate buying and eating process. The program calculates the total number of chocolates you can enjoy based on the amount of money you spend, considering the price of chocolates and the potential to exchange wrappers for additional chocolates.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to input the amount of money they wish to spend on chocolates.
- It assumes each chocolate costs $1 and calculates how many chocolates can be bought with the given amount.
- As you eat chocolates, you collect wrappers. Every three wrappers can be exchanged for 1 dollar, which can be used to buy more chocolates.
- The process repeats until you can no longer buy more chocolates or exchange wrappers for money.

## Running the Program
To run ChocolateShop, you need to have Java installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Program**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing `ChocolateShop.java`.
   - Run the command `javac ChocolateShop.java` to compile the program.

2. **Execute the Program**:
   - After compilation, run the command `java ChocolateShop`.
   - Input the amount of money you want to spend when prompted.

3. **Observe the Output**:
   - The program will display how many chocolates you get and the number of wrappers collected after each purchase and exchange.
